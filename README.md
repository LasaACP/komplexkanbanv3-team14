This repository is a complex numbers library that includes definitions for numerous operators in c++ such as +=, *=, -=, /=, <<, and >>.
It also includes functions that return the results of plugging in a complex number to a trigometric function such as cosh, sinh, sin, tan, and a lot more.
Coded and tested in two weeks using a combination of c++ and catch 2 to implement and test all functions.
